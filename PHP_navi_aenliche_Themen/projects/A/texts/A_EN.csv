"B.JPG","The aim of the project is to study changes in the availability of raw materials and strategies of their use as well as the acceptance and use of technological innovations in two model regions in prehistoric South-Eastern Europe, namely the Banat and the western coast of the Black Sea. The comparative analysis will highlight how these factors have been instrumental for the formation, stability, and decline of social groups."
"B.JPG","The project aims at investigating and reconstructing the dynamics and the diversity of the socio-cultural manifestations on the Iberian Peninsula in relation to the use of resources. The analysis will be conducted in a comprehensive way using a long-term perspective from the third to the first millennia BC. By comparing detailed studies in two regions with markedly different natural conditions there will be the chance to identify resources as factors in these processes more perspicuously as before."
"B.JPG","This project will investigate the circulation of cultural resources in the Persian Gulf. It will try to pinpoint the motivation of this exchange, which primarily aimed at obtaining precious stones for the Mesopotamian city-states and empires of the third millennium BC. The consequences of these far-reaching processes for the formation of local resource-cultures in the Gulf will be particularly emphasized. To achieve this an archaeological survey will be carried out in the Iranian province of Hormuzgan."
"B04/Winterweide_Tosor_013.JPG","The project aims at replacing the traditional concept of the palace-economy, used to describe small and middle-sized Kingdoms in second millennium BC Syria, by the model of palace ResourceCultures and to explore the development of these systems. This new concept emphasises the systematic endowment of materials and objects with symbolic value in order to strengthen political power. In one case study, the importance of objects made of precious materials in palatial contexts is investigated, while a second case study is devoted to the so-called “International Style” as a political resource."
"B05/C05.jpg","This project will investigate the agricultural resources of Ancient Palestine (Bronze to Iron Age; with a focus on the cultivation of plants) by conducting two case studies (each as dissertation project): an archaeobotanical case study analysing the natural scientific and ethnographic sources, and a biblical archaeological case study on the archaeological, historical and literal sources. The work program will be specifically organized to arrange a very close cooperation between both case studies."
"B06/C06.png","The transition from Bronze- to Iron Age in the Eastern Mediterranean stands as an example for an analysis of the interaction between socio-cultural processes and the use and control of resources. A case study dealing with the Southern Levant will study both archaeological and philological evidence under this point of view. Later on further regions will be included to achieve a better understanding of economic, political and historic processes during the 13th and 12th centuries BC."
