"C02/C02.JPG","The aim of the project is to analyse poetical reflections on resource-based experiences in two case studies (both of diachronic and synchronic character). The first deals with instructions imbedded in Hesiod’s archaic poem ‘Works and Days’. These instructions are to be studied in terms of a practical interpretation. It is also intended to examine the poem’s mythical parts in order to achieve a better understanding of how resources are evaluated in (their) culture-specific context(s). In the second case study texts of the Hellenistic period, especially Arat’s ‘Phaenomena’, are to be analysed in respect to the reception of Hesiod’s text as a cultural resource (above all in Alexandria). Additionally the specific relevance of real resources in poetical texts will be examined."
"C03/C03.jpg","The concept of ‘resource’ as the basis of formation and change of social groups is used to create a new image of the relationship between processes of settlement and the formation of societies and cultural identities on the Italian peninsula during the 1st millennium BC. ResourceComplexes related to metals and arable soil in settlement areas at the Tyrrhenian Sea (dominated by Etruscan Cities) and the Magna Graecia will be examined and compared.  Access to symbolic orders, representations and valuation of resources is gained via a contextual analysis of objects and monuments in specific public spaces: cemeteries, shrines, settlement centres."
"C04/Winterweide_Tosor_013.JPG","This project deals with the role of resource complexes for the creation, maintenance and expansion of important religious institutions in South and Central Asia. Ethnographic and ethno-historical data about religious resources will be collected in extensive fieldworks in India, Kyrgyzstan and Iran. These case studies illustrate the socio-cultural practices necessary for achieving and converting religious resources, they serve to identify the interdependencies between religion, economy and state and they help to understand, how conflicts about religious resources develop."
"C05/C05.jpg","The aspect of wasting or investing in profit-orientated or ideological capital will be investigated with the example of hoards and church buildings on the Baltic island of Gotland. The hoards will be analysed according to their degree of fragmentation, the quality of craftsmanship, the iconographical meaning and the origin from other economical regions. The complementary study is focussing on the investment-volume of the church building, its decoration on the exterior as well as in the interior."
"C06/C06.png","The project is dealing with the South Indian resources rice and medicinal plants. Rice is the main crop in the alluvial areas of the southeast Indian River Delta region, medicinal plants grow mainly in the forests of the mountainous regions of southern India. In the first study it will be demonstrated, how the rice-economy and the products paddy and rice are embedded into specific, historically grown, patterns of meaning and social structures. In the second study the traditional practices, necessary for the production of medicinal plants, are being explored. In addition it will be examined, which concepts of nature, environment, sustainability and effectiveness are determining the use of medicinal plants."
"C07/C07.jpg","As cultural resources ‘Icons’ are a part of a complex process and should therefore be analysed from a diachronic perspective. In the first phase of this project the Viking ship graves from Oseberg, Gokstad and Hedeby as well as the monuments from Jelling will be studied. The importance of these monuments in the processes of the creation of identity and nations is not yet researched.  With the investigation of the significance of these monuments in the past as well as today it should be revealed that what might appear as archaeological objectivity is always depending on the contemporary view and interaction between science, media and the public."
